Neovim Configuration Manager (Swap/Backup/Try Configurations Easily)

<img src="media/list_example.png">

I created this package because I wanted to try out Lazyvim (which is why it is referenced a few times) and other similar configuration packages and plugins without having to manually move my configuration files each time. I also wanted to be able to easily switch between configurations.

> **Note**
> Tests have been added. Though, this is still to be considered a WIP. Currently Linux and Windows only.

### Notable Features (so far)

---

- Add multiple configurations
- Conveniently switch between said configs
- Automatic initial backup
- Backup selected/all configurations (demonstrated below)

### Install Notes

---

> **Warning**
> Make a backup of your current configuration. While NCM will backup your configuration for you, always better to be safe than sorry.

This package uses a file system symlink to swap/change which configuration Neovim will load.
When you select a configuration using the load option, it will be symlinked to the `~/.config/nvim` directory.

> **Note**
> An automated backup and setup process has been added.

### Update Notes

---

<details open>
<summary>0.0.6</summary>

* Each configuration now has it's own `~/.config/nvim` and `~/.local/share/nvim` directories, avoiding any complications when a configuration uses a different nvim package manager, or conflicting versions of plugins. 
* Enhanced Windows support (detects XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_DATA_HOME and acts accordingly, else uses $LOCALAPPDATA)  

</details>

<details>
<summary>0.0.5</summary>

* Initial Windows support
* Added `ncm backup` command
* Automated backup and setup process

</details>

1. `sudo apt install just` (or equivalent for your distro)
2. `git clone https://github.com/instance.id/ncm-rs.git`
3. `cd ncm-rs`
4. `just install` (installs to `~/.local/bin/ncm` (might need to be added to $PATH on Windows))
