# ncm-rs

Neovim Configuration Manager (Store/Change/Swap Configurations)

<img src="media/list_example.png">

I created this package because I wanted to try out Lazyvim (which is why it is referencec a few times) and other similar configuration packages and plugins without having to manually move my configuration files each time. I also wanted to be able to easily switch between configurations.

> **Note**
> Tests have been added. Though, this is still to be considered a WIP. Currently Linux only. Will add Windows support in the near future.

### Notable Features (so far)

---

- Add multiple configurations
- Conveniently switch between said configs


### Install Notes

---

> **Warning** 
> Make a backup!

### Make a backup of your current configuration. Always better to be safe than sorry.

> **Note**
> ### An automated backup and movement of the original configuration has been added.

~~To use this package, first backup your current configuration. If requested, automatic backup and movement of the original configuration could be added in the future. Unless/until that happens, you will need to move your configuration manually.~~

> **Note** 
> For the time being this package uses a symlink to swap/change which confuration Neovim will load.

When you select a configuration using the load option, it will be symlinked to the `~/.config/nvim` directory.
